# Bachelor Thesis: Stock trend classification using LSTM and Transformer models
This research aims at comparing the performances of LSTM and Transformer models on stock market forecasting.
The objective of this research is to show the difference in performance of a LSTM and a Transformer model on stock prediction. Inspired by the success of Transformer in modeling the sequential data in NLP, this paper aims at evaluating the power of these Deep Learning models on three companiesâ€™ stock and the commodity price of energy, using different granularities. The scope of the project is to uncover the sensitivity of these models in understanding historical data, while comparing parallel (Transformer) and sequential (LSTM) operations. Considering the market efficiency form as weak as possible to implement high-frequency trading strategies, this study is aimed at finding which model is best under different industry conditions, different financial tools (stocks vs commodities) and mostly, under different time period analyses: minutes and days. The task will be that of correctly classifying whether the price grows (+1) or it stays the same/plummets (0) at any point in time, considering a look back period 1 of 5 days.
